# Bank Loan Prediction 
This project is used to predict whether the person eligible for loan or not by using information provided by him
The project is based upon the attributes that are provided by the client in the csv (comma-separated values) format 
most of the csv files would be messier so we check the csv and preprocess to get better results
we use many machine learning algorithms to get the higher accuracy score 
select the machine learning algorithms with higher accuracy score and train and test it well and perform the operation that we needed
